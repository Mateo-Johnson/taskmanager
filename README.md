# ESP32-S3 E-Ink Task Manager

A low-power task board built with an ESP32 and an e-ink display. It pulls to-do items from a local or cloud source, renders them in a clean, always-readable layout, and updates only when needed to maximize battery life. Meant to be used as a keychain, so must be extremely small!
